<p>The additional operations that can be performed within Cytoscape 
after MiSink is installed provide means for interactive traversal 
of interaction network and incorporation of its interesting 
fragments into Cytoscape graph. 
<p>This process is composed of two, repeatedly applied steps:

<ol type="I">
  <li>
   adding vertices (proteins) and edges (interactions) visible on a page that 
   advertises it is MiSink ready by providing links hidden under 'MiSink icons' 
     (<img src="dip/images/misink/cdipB.png" border="1"/>
   and
      <img src="dip/images/misink/cdipG.png" border="1"/> in case
   of DIP Web site).
   <br>For example, clicking on these icons appearing on 
   <a href="javascript:wop('http://dip.doe-mbi.ucla.edu/dip/Browse.cgi?PK=1618&D=1')">this</A> 
   DIP page that lists interactions of yeast's <i>Cdc34</i> will result in adding either
   all (<img src="dip/images/misink/cdipB.png" border="1"/>
   icon) or only core (<img src="dip/images/misink/cdipG.png" border="1"/>
   icon) interactions to the current Cytoscape graph. In a similar manner, 
   clicking on the icon visible on 
   <a href="javascript:wop('http://dip.doe-mbi.ucla.edu/dip/DIPview.cgi?IK=40347')">this</A>
   DIP page that displays information about interactions of <i>Cdc34</i> and <i>ubiquitin</i> 
   will result in addition this interaction to the current Cytoscape graph.  
   Finally, clicking on the MiSink icon visible on 
   <a href="javascript:wop('http://dip.doe-mbi.ucla.edu/dip/DIPview.cgi?PK=1549')">this</A>
   DIP page that describes <i>Cdc34</i> protein will result in addition of just this protein 
   to the current network.  
   <p>[<i><b>Note</b></i>] Some sites (including DIP) might provide control on
    the depth of edges imported from pages listing interactions. By default,
    clicking on the MiTap icons  will result in importing only interactions
    listed on a given page.  However, choosing 'Edge Import Depth: 1.5' 
    option within MiSink configuration panel (see Plugins->MiSink menu) 
    will result in importing, in addition to all the relevant edges
    visible on a given page, also edges connecting <i>any two nodes</i> 
    present on the page.  Depending on circumstances, the user can toggle between
    the two modes by choosing either '1' or '1.5' on MiSink configuration panel.
   <p>
  </li>
  <li>
   finding information about the neighbouring vertices that might be interesting
   enough to be added to the current network. In its simplest form it can be done 
   by either the interactions using capacities provided within a given Web site.
   For example, clicking on any of 'Links' bullet visible on DIP pages listing
   interactions will display all the interactions of the coresponding protein
   known within DIP. As a time-saving alternative the same page will be loaded
   into the browser after choosing the MiSink->DIP option from the pop-up menu 
   that can be activated within Cytoscape by right-clicking on the vertex 
   (protein) of interest.
