<p>MiSink is an add-on module (plugin) for 
<a href="http://www.cytoscape.org/">Cytoscape</a> - an open
source platform for visualization and integration of biological
interaction data. Installation of MiSink converts it into an 
interactive, graphical interface to DIP and, potentially other, 
other MiSink-enabled Web sites. This is possible, from the 
end-user perspective, by implementing, within MiSink, three 
additional operations:

<table border="0" width="75%">
  <tr>
   <td width="2%"><br></td>
   <td>  
<ol type="I">
  <li> 
   adding to the current Cytoscape network nodes and edges 'advertised' 
   by a Web site through 
     <img src="dip/images/misink/cdipB.png" border="1"/>
   and
      <img src="dip/images/misink/cdipG.png" border="1"/>
   icons.
   <p>
  </li>
  <li> 
   visiting sites that provide annotation of the imported nodes/edges 
   <p>
  </li>
  <li> 
   finding information about the neighbouring nodes
   <p>
  </li>   
</ol>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p> In addition, MiSink can be used to import into Cytoscape data from 
tab-delimited or XML files. Data in practically arbitrary
format can be imported thanks to strightforward configuration based
on simple, yet powerful, XPath language.

    <p><b>A.</b> The 'cDIP' icons available on some of the DIP Web pages 
     can be used to load additional information into the current Cytoscape 
     network.  Depending on the context, interactions (green for core, blue 
     for all) or just nodes can be imported.

    <p><b>B.</b> Clicking on one of the 'cDIP' icons resulted in loading of the
    additional interactions into the current network.

    <p><b>C.</b> Choosing 'UniProt' or 'RefSeq' options from the pulldown menu
     brings up corresponding page on, respectively, UniProt or RefSeq site. 


    <p><b>D.</b> An additional menu (accessible through the right mouse click) is 
    available after installation of the MiSink Plugin for nodes uploaded from DIP 
    web site. Choosing 'DIP' option there loads corresponding DIP web page into 
    the default web browser.
