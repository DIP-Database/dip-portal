      MiTap tree provides access to information identified by MiTap as 
      related to the currently displayed Web page. The <i>Scan</i> branch 
      contains information directly extracted from the current page (or 
      loaded from a file - see <b>G</b>), <i>Expand</i> contains elements 
      added by clicking on Expand button (see <b>D</b>) and <i>Filter</i> 
      - only elements selected by applying filtering criteria set with 
      the <i>Select</i> tab.

      Right-clicking on a tree element brings up a <i>MiTap:Note</i> dialog 
      that can be used to locally annotate individual elements of the tree. 
      Elements with attached annotation notes are highlighted in yellow.
      The annotation data is stored permanently within user's profile and 
      thus persists between Firefox sessions.
