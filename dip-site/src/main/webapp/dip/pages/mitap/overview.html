<p>MiTap is an add-on module for the 
<A href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox">Firefox</A> browser. 
When used together with the 
<A href="http://dip.doe-mbi.ucla.edu/misink/About.cgi">MiSink</A> 
plugin it provides means for interactive import of interaction 
data from virtaully any Web page into 
<a href="http://www.cytoscape.org/">Cytoscape</a>. This is
possible even in case of Web sites such as
<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=PubMed">PubMed</A>,
<A HREF="http://expasy.org">SwissProt</A>/<A href="http://uniprot.org">UniProt</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.yeastgenome.org">SGD</A>
that, natively, do not suppot Cytoscape integration. 

<p>MiTap operates in the background by scanning the incoming Web 
pages (A) for patterns it can recognize as potentially leading to 
information about proteins and their interactions. Once found, these 
patterns are used to query public repositories of biological data. 
Information found this way is presented to the user within MiTap 
sidebar as a hierarchical tree (B). The user can follow the links 
provided within MiTap sidebar (C) to retrieve directly information 
available from the original data providers or import the retrieved 
interaction network into Cytoscape (D).

<p> In addition, individual elements of the MiTap tree can be annotated
by the user; the contents of the MiTap sidebar can be saved to a local 
file and then retrieved for future use.
