<h1>Dscam: Cell-cell recognition molecule</h1>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="$DIP_IMG/dscam_250.png" alt="dscam dimer" style="float:left"></p>
<p>Dscam is an acronym for the Down Syndrome Cell Adhesion Molecule.
It is expressed on the surface of neurons and is essential for neural 
circuit assembly.  By alternative splicing, the insect Dscam gene gives rise to 18,048 
different isoforms. Each isoform is specific for self-binding.  That is, each isoform
binds to an identical copy, but not to other isoforms.  This remarkable specificity
allows branches from a common neuron to recognize one another as self.
These "sister neurites" will have identical Dscam isoforms expressed on their surfaces.
Upon contact, the sister neurites will bind each other through like Dscam isoforms
and initiate a signal for the neurites to repel each other. The self-avoidance signal produces
non-overlapping (arboreal) receptive fields.  In contast,  insects lacking the Dscam gene show
bundled neuronal patterns and are non-viable.</p>

<p>The Dscam molecule contains a cytoplasmic domain, a trasmembrane domain, and
a large extracellular domain composed of ten Ig domains and six fibronectin type III repeats.  The
self-binding properties of the molecule are encoded by the N-terminal eight Ig domains;  its
structure has been determined by X-ray crystallography at 4.2 Angstrom resolution.
The structure reveals a large, two-fold symmetric dimer interface (4500 Angstroms^2)
that is spread over three of the eight Ig domains.
These three domains are variable (rather than constant) regions of
the molecule. The highly variable composition of the interface appears critical for
providing its exclusive self-binding specificity.  The path of the eight Ig domains takes
an "S" shape; a reverse turn follows each of the variable domains.
This conformation is likely induced upon binding, allowing the
three variable domains to interact in an antiparallel fashion.  The conformational change
causes a 120 Angstrom contraction of the molecule, which could provide the
signal for self repulsion.</p>
