<p>The Database of Interacting Proteins (DIP) archives and evaluates experimentally 
determined interactions between proteins.</p>  The interactions in DIP are culled 
from peer-reviewed literature and are manually entered into the database by expert 
curators.  <a href="Submit.cgi">Direct data submission</a> by researchers, with 
curator oversight, helps streamline this process.  In both cases, the resulting 
high-quality curation conforms to the <a href="http://www.psidev.info">Proteomic 
Standards Initiative</a>'s Molecular Interaction (PSI-MI) format, allowing simplified 
data mining and smooth exchange of data between interaction databases.</p>

<p>DIP is a member of the International Molecular-interaction Exchange Consortium 
(<a href="http://imex.sf.net">IMEx</a>), a group of the major public providers of 
interaction data.  Other participating databases include 
<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact">IntAct</a>, 
<a href="http://mint.bio.uniroma2.it/mint">MINT</a>, 
<a href="http://mips.gsf.de/genre/proj/mpact">MPact</a>, and 
<a href="http://www.thebiogrid.org">BioGRID</a>.  The databases of IMEx work together 
to prevent duplications of curation effort, collecting data from non-overlapping 
sources and sharing the curated interaction data.</p>

<p>In addition to manual curation, interactions in DIP undergo computational evaluation.
The evaluation algorithms judge whether a reported interaction is likely to be biologically 
relevant by comparing its properties to those of the most reliable, <i>core</i> subset 
of DIP interactions. The results of evaluation are displayed on the interaction's 
information page.</p>
