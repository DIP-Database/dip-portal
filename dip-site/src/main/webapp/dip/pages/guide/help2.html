    (Database of Interacting Proteins) database lists protein pairs that are 
    known to interact with each other.  By <em>interact</em> we mean that two 
    amino acid chains were experimentally identified to bind to each other.  
    The database lists such pairs to aid those studying a particular 
    protein-protein interaction but also those investigating entire regulatory
    and signaling pathways as well as those studying the organisation and 
    complexity of the protein interaction network at the cellular level.

    <p>The DIP database is composed of nodes and edges:

    <p><strong>DIP Nodes</strong> (<i>proteins</i>)
    <br><font size=+1>E</font>ach protein participating in a DIP interaction 
    is idetified by a unique identifier of the form 
    &lt;<b><i>DIP:</b>nnn<b>N</i></b>&gt; and cross-references to, at least, 
    one of the major protein databases -
    <b>PIR</b>,
    <b> SWISSPROT</b><i> and/or</i>
    <b>GENBANK</b>

    In addition, some basic information about each protein, such as name, 
    function, subcellular localization and cross-references to other biological
    databased is stored locally (if available) in case the cross-referenced 
    databases are not accessible.

    <p><strong>DIP Edges</strong> (<i>interactions</i>)
    <br><font size=+1>T</font>he information about each DIP interaction is 
    identified by a unique identifier of the form 
    &lt;<b><i>DIP:</b>nnn<b>E</i></b>&gt; that provides access to information 
    such as the region involved in the interaction, the dissociation constant 
    and the experimental methods used to identify and characterize the 
    interaction.


    <h3><a name="SEARCHES">Searching DIP</a></h3>
    
    The DIP database can be searched in a number of ways in order to identify the starting
    point for exploration of the protein interaction network. Please, see

     its short description.

    <p><strong><a name="SP">Primary Database reference(s)</a></strong>
    <br> <font size=+1>A</font>t least one reference to PIR, SWISSPROT and/or
    GENBANK entry is provided.

    <p><strong><a name="SP">Cross-references</a></strong>
    <br> <font size=+1>R</font>references to other database entries related to
    the protein of interest as retrieved from SwissProt and NR BLAST entries.
    The list of cross-references is subdivided into (P)rotein, (D)omain and
    (F)eature (eg motifs) categories. 




    <p><strong><a name="superfamily">Superfamily</a></strong>

    <p><strong><a name="SP">Organism</a></strong>
    <br> <font size=+1>T</font>he organism producing the protein. A 
    cross-reference to the TaxonID database is provided for additional
    information.

    <p><strong><a name="SP">Function</a></strong>
    <br> <font size=+1>A</font> short description of the protein's function
     within the cell.

    <p><strong><a name="SP">Localization</a></strong>
    <br> <font size=+1>L</font>ocalization of the protein within the cell (if 
    known)

    <p><strong><a name="SP">Keywords</a></strong>
    <br> <font size=+1>K</font>eywords associated with the protein. They might
    describe its structure and/or sequence features, biological activity, 
    function, cellular localization, <i>etc.</i>
  



    <h3><a name="IFIELDS">DIP Edge Annotation</a></h3>  

    <p><strong><a name="SP">DIP interaction ID</a></strong>
    <br> <font size=+1>T</font>his is a unique identifier for each interaction
    described within the DIP database. It has a format 
    &lt;<b><i>DIP:</b>nnn<b>E</i></b>&gt;. For example,
    DIP:1234E referes to the interaction between actin and foofoo in 
    <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. Please, use the DIP interaction ID when referring 
    to an interaction described within the DIP database.   


    <p><strong><a name="Range">Residue Ranges</a></strong><br>
    <font size=+1>T</font>he range is meant to specify more accurately which

    biological significance of the interaction is.

    <h3><a name="General">General comments</a></h3>

<p>If you know of an interaction but do not want to look for the unique 
    Id's, or don't want to submit it for some other reason, or if you know of 
    a protein-protein interaction where the PIR/SWISSPROT/GENBANK file for one
    or both of the proteins is not yet available please 
    <a href="mailto:dip@mbi.ucla.edu">email us</a> with the names of the two 
    proteins and any other information you would like to include. Thanks.
    
<p>
    For help on finding the Id for a protein go to <a href="http://pir.georgetown.edu/"> for PIR accession code
    </a> or to <a href="http://www.expasy.ch/cgi-bin/sprot-search-ful">for SWISSPROT code </a> and for
     <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/entrez/query.fcgi?CMD=search&DB=protein">
    NCBI/EMBL gi</a>.
        
    One of these code (PIR/SWISSPROT) is nececessary to enter a new protein 
    protein interaction.
                         
    <p>DIP<sup>TM</sup> is updated via the web by, both professional curators,
    as well as by volunteers.  One doesn't have to be the discoverer of the
    interaction to make a submission - it's enough to provide us with the pair
    of interacting proteins and a reference to an experiment identifying the
    interactions.
