<h2>Contents of DIP: nodes and edges</h2>

DIP keeps track of proteins and their interactions.  Graphically, proteins can 
be represented by <i>nodes</i> (circles) and interactions by <i>edges</i> 
(lines):<br/>

<br/></font>
The above <i>graph</i> shows the protein-protein interaction network of the 
kinetochore, the protein complex responsible for separating chromosomes during
eukaryotic cell division. Notice that some of the edges, the curved ones, 
indicate a self interaction: an interaction between a protein and another copy 
of itself.

<p><b>DIP nodes</b> (proteins)<br/>
Each protein node in DIP is assigned a unique identifier of the form 'DIP-###N' ('N' for node).  
   Each node is also cross-referenced to at least one of the major protein databases
   <a href="http://www.pir.uniprot.org/" target="window"> UniProt</a> and 
   <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/RefSeq/" target="window">RefSeq</a>.  
   DIP additionally stores some basic information about each protein, including name, organism, and a 
   description.<br /><font size="-2"><br /></font>

   <p><b>DIP edges</b> (interactions)<br />
   Each interaction edge in DIP is assigned a unique identifier of the form 'DIP-###E' ('E' for edge).
   DIP stores information such as the region involved in the interaction, the dissociation constant and the 
   experimental methods used to identify and characterize the interaction.<br />

<h2>Classifying interactions</h2>

Interactions may be classified according to the level of contact between the interacting proteins.
   Thus, interactions may be:
   <ul>
    <li><b>direct</b>, if the interacting proteins touch each other directly;</li>
    <li><b>physical</b>, if the proteins physically associate, with the possibility that another molecule 
     mediates the association; or</li>
    <li><b>functional</b>, if the proteins are linked by a related function, regardless of whether they 
     physically associate.</li>
   </ul>
   DIP currently records <i>direct</i> and <i>physical</i> interactions.  For functional interactions, try the 
   <a href="http://mysql5.mbi.ucla.edu/cgi-bin/functionator/pronav">Prolinks</a> database.<br /><br />
