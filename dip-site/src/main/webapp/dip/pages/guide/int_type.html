 The terminology describing interaction types reflects the amount of information 
provided by the individual experiments used to measure an interaction.  An 
experiment may provide only very general information (e.g. that a set of 
proteins may be purified together) or may provide detailed information about 
specific physical contacts or covalent bonds.  The table below defines the terms
used within DIP; please note that these terms may convey different information 
than their common usage might imply.

 <td class="tcell2" align="left">
  DIP <i>'associations'</i> are groups of proteins that form
  one or more physical complexes. <i>'Association'</i> is used when
  experimental evidence is too weak to
  guarantee that all reported interacting molecules are present within
  the same physical complex.  For example, some affinity experiments
  report interactions between a matrix-bound bait molecule (green 
  in the figure) and additional prey molecules.  These experiments 
  may not distinguish between prey molecules bound together in the 
  same complex (i.e. yellow, red, and pink at the top of
  the figure) and prey molecules bound in separate complexes (i.e.
  red versus blue in the figure).  There is not enough information
  to designate a <i>'physical'</i> interaction, so <i>'association'</i> 
  is used instead.

  <i>'Physical'</i> interactions in DIP describe a physical complex
  formed by all of the listed molecules. In other words, 
  each pair of interacting
  molecules has been observed within the same physical complex.
  An experiment reporting a <i>'physical'</i> interaction
  does not eliminate the possiblity that additional unidentified
  proteins provide a bridge connecting proteins 
  within the complex.

   Molecules participating in a <i>'direct'</i> interaction have been shown
   to directly contact one-another (i.e. they have van der Waals contacts).
   Note that a homo-oligomer indicates a <i>direct</i> 
   interaction, even though some subunits may not be in direct contact.

 <th class="tcell2">covalent</th>
 <td class="tcell2" align="left" >
   In a <i>'covalent'</i> interaction, all participating molecules
   are connected by covalent bonds.  For proteins, the most common
   sub-type of covalent interaction is the disulfide bond (MI:0408), formed
   by a sulfur-sulfur bond between two cysteins.
