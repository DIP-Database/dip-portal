<h1>Evaluating Interactions</h1>
<p>The interactions recorded in DIP may or may not reflect actual interactions between proteins.
   This uncertainty stems from the accuracy (or inaccuracy) of published interactions.  For example,
   large-scale, genome-wide experiments tend to yield many false positive results, where an interaction
   is recorded that is not actually real.</p>

<br />
<p>To separate the interactions that are likely to be real from those that may not be, DIP
   evaluates its interaction data.  The most reliable subset of interactions, or CORE set, is
   selected using the following criteria.</p>
   <img class="core" src="$DIP_IMG/dip_core_240ht.png" alt="DIP CORE interactions">
   An interaction is considered reliable if:
   <ul class="list">
    <li class="list">it was identified in at least one non genome-wide
     experiment. In these cases the number of independent, 
     small scale (SMSC) experiments is reported.</li>
    <li class="list">it was identified independently more than once. In
     these cases the number of all independent experiments (MLTI) is reported.<br /></li>
    <li class="list">the paralogs of each of the interacting proteins also
     interact.  In these cases the number of paralogous 
     interactions (PVMS) is reported. (See 
     <a href="http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/abstract/M100037-MCP200v1">Deane et al.</a>
     for details.)</li>
   </ul>
<p>The status of each interaction, as well as the criteria that contributed to its 
   classification as a member of the CORE subset, are reported on the corresponding 
   <a href="Guide.cgi?SM=0:3">interaction information page</a>.
   In addition, the set of reliable interactions (DIP_CORE) can be 
   <a href="http://dip.doe-mbi.ucla.edu/dip/Download.cgi">downloaded</a>
   as a list of protein pairs.</p>
<p>This CORE subset can be used as a starting point for the analysis of the interaction network as well
   as a reference set in the development/evaluation of protein-protein interaction prediction methods.</p>
