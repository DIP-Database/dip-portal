<p>The Cytoscape Export Panel provides means for exporting interactions
into Cytoscape visualization program supplanted with the MiSink plugin.</p>

<p>Pressing one of the <i>ALL</i> or <i>FLT</i> button adds <i>ALL</i>
or  <i>FIL</i>tered records listed in the table to the network currently

only these records that are currently selected within th table.

<p>The <i>Neighbor</i> option specifies what interactions other then the
set chosen above are also added: <b>&lt;1&gt;</b> adds interactions 
of the originally selected molecules, <b>&lt;1+&gt;</b> includes
also interactions between the neighbors.
