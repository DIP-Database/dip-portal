<p> Validation of the DIP links is performed in order to identify the most 
reliable subset of the database. This CORE subset can be used as a starting 
point for the analysis of the interaction network as well as a reference set 
in the development/evaluation of protein-protein interaction prediction 
methods.


<p>The initial validation is performed by using two simple criteria:


<ul>
 <li> 
   a given link is considered reliable if it was identified in at least
   one non genome-wide experiment. In those cases the number of independent,
   small scale experiments  (SMSC) is reported.
 </li>
 <li>
   a given link is considered reliable if it was identified independently
   more than once. In those cases the number of all independent experiments
   (MLTI) is reported. 
 </li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, each interaction is analyzed using the 
<A HREF="http://dip.doe-mbi.ucla.edu/dip/Services.cgi?SM=2">PVM approach</A>
which identifies interacting protein pairs with experimentally determined 
interactions between their respective paralogs. In those cases the number 
of paralogous interactions (PVMS) is reported
(see <A HREF="http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/abstract/M100037-MCP200v1">
<i>Deane at al.</i></A> for details).

<p>The status of each link, as well as the criteria that contributed to its 
classification as a member of the CORE subset, are reported on the corresponding 
<i>DIP LINK</i> page. In addition the set of validated links from 
<i>S. cerevisiae</i> (DIP_CORE) can be 
<A HREF="http://dip.doe-mbi.ucla.edu/dip/Download.cgi?SM=4">downloaded</A>
as a list of validated protein pairs.
