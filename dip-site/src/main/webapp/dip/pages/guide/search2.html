    (Database of Interacting Proteins) database lists protein pairs that are 
    known to interact with each other.  By <em>interact</em> we mean that two 
    amino acid chains were experimentally identified to bind to each other.  
    The database lists such pairs to aid those studying a particular 
    protein-protein interaction but also those investigating entire regulatory
    and signaling pathways as well as those studying the organisation and 
    complexity of the protein interaction network at the cellular level.

    <p><strong>DIP proteins</strong> (<i>nodes</i>)
    <br><font size=+1>E</font>ach protein participating in a DIP interaction 
    is idetified by a unique identifier of the form 
    &lt;<b><i>DIP:</b>nnn<b>N</i></b>&gt; and cross-references to, at least, 
    one of the major protein databases -
    <b>PIR</b>,
    <b> SWISSPROT</b><i> and/or</i>
    <b>GENBANK</b>

    In addition, some basic information about each protein, such as name, 
    function, subcellular localization and cross-references to other biological
    databased is stored locally (if available) in case the cross-referenced 
    databases are not accessible.

    <p><strong>DIP interactions</strong> (<i>edges</i>)
    <br><font size=+1>T</font>he information about each DIP interaction is 
    identified by a unique identifier of the form 
    &lt;<b><i>DIP:</b>nnn<b>E</i></b>&gt; that provides access to information 
    such as the region involved in the interaction, the dissociation constant 
    and the experimental methods used to identify and characterize the 
    interaction.

    GENBANK entry is provided.

    <br><font size=+1>T</font>he superfamily specified in the PIR entry.


    <p><strong><a name="SP">Organism</a></strong>
    <br> <font size=+1>T</font>he organism producing the protein. A

    <br> <font size=+1>A</font> short description of the protein's function
     within the cell.

    <p><strong><a name="SP">Localization</a></strong>
    <br> <font size=+1>L</font>ocalization of the protein within the cell (if 
    known)

    <p><strong><a name="SP">Keywords</a></strong>
    <br> <font size=+1>K</font>eywords associated with the protein. They might
    describe its structure and/or sequence features, biological activity, 
    function, cellular localization, <i>etc.</i>
  
    <h3><a name="IFIELDS">Interaction Entry Fields</a></h3>  

    <p><strong><a name="SP">DIP interaction ID</a></strong>
    <br> <font size=+1>T</font>his is a unique identifier for each interaction
    described within the DIP database. It has a format 
    &lt;<b><i>DIP:</b>nnn<b>E</i></b>&gt;. For example,
    DIP:1234E referes to the interaction between actin and foofoo in 
    <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. Please, use the DIP interaction ID when referring 
    to an interaction described within the DIP database.   


    <p><strong><a name="Range">Residue Ranges</a></strong><br>
    <font size=+1>T</font>he range is meant to specify more accurately which 
    parts of the proteins are directly involved in the interaction.  

    <p><strong><a name="Domain">Protein Domain</a></strong><br> 
    <font size=+1>T</font>he interacting domain name.  An incomplete list of 
    <a href="javascript:openAWindow('domains.html','Domain')">domain names</a>
    is available.

    <br><font size=+1>T</font>he dissociation constant of the protein-protein 
    complex in mols/liter (<u>M</u>).

    <br><font size=+1>T</font>he experimental method(s) used to identify and/or
    characterize the interaction.

    studying the interactions.

    <p><strong><a name="Comments">Comments</a></strong>
    <br><font size=5>A</font>dditional comments supplied by the person who
    deposited the interaction.  Comments could include an explanation 
    (evidence) why the proteins are thought to interact, and what the 
    biological significance of the interaction is.

<p>If you know of an interaction but do not want to look for the unique 
    Id's, or don't want to submit it for some other reason, or if you know of 
    a protein-protein interaction where the PIR/SWISSPROT/GENBANK file for one
    or both of the proteins is not yet available please 
    <a href="mailto:dip@mbi.ucla.edu">email us</a> with the names of the two 
    proteins and any other information you would like to include. Thanks.
    
<p>
    For help on finding the Id for a protein go to <a href="http://pir.georgetown.edu/"> for PIR accession code
    </a> or to <a href="http://www.expasy.ch/cgi-bin/sprot-search-ful">for SWISSPROT code </a> and for
     <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/entrez/query.fcgi?CMD=search&DB=protein">
    NCBI/EMBL gi</a>.
        
    One of these code (PIR/SWISSPROT) is nececessary to enter a new protein 
    protein interaction.
                         
    <p>DIP<sup>TM</sup> is updated via the web by, both professional curators,
    as well as by volunteers.  One doesn't have to be the discoverer of the
    interaction to make a submission - it's enough to provide us with the pair
    of interacting proteins and a reference to an experiment identifying the
    interactions.
