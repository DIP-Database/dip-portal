<p>
 Interactions reported in DIP are inferred from experimental evidence. In the simplest 
case one particular piece of evidence supports exactly one interaction.  In more 
complex experimental setups the same piece of experimental evidence can support 
more than one interaction. It is also possible for an interaction to be supported by 
multiple pieces of evidence which, individually, are not sufficient to support it.  
In order to distinguish between these different modes of interaction inference, the 
evidence supporting interactions is classified within DIP as:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  experiments directly supporting interactions, as reported in the original IMEx records;
 </li>
 <li>
  experiments supporting additional, automatically inferred interactions that are derived 
  from the original IMEx records. They most commonly correspond to binary, physical 
  associations (possibly not direct) that were inferred from multi-protein associations;
 </li>
 <li>
  author's inferences based on one or more individual pieces of experimental evidence. 
  Some, or all the pieces of evidence used for the inferrence might have been originally 
  reported in an earlier publication. Therefore, in contrast to the other two classes, 
  author's inferences do NOT correspond to independent experimental observations of 
  the inferred interaction.
 </li>
</ul>
