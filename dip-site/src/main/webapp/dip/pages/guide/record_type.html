 The vast majority of the recently processed experimental evidence collected in DIP is 
 curated according to the rules agreed upon by the members of the IMEx Consortium. 
 Apart from the fully compliant IMEx records, DIP contains:  
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  provisional IMEx records that are curated according to IMEx rules but not yet 
  assigned formal IMEx accession numbers/identifiers;
 </li>
 <li>
  legacy records that precede formation of the IMEx Consurtium and thus curated at a 
  detail level that does not comply with the IMEx Consortium curation rules.
 </li>

</ul>
