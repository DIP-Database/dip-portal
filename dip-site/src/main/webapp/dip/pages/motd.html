         Welcome to the new and, hopefully, improved DIP Database site. While 
         retaining most of the functionalities of the legacy site, the new
         portal utilizes modern web technologies to offer new graphical user 
         interface while continuing tight integration with Cytoscape. Additional 
         features include direct access to MIQL/PSICQUIC search engine site
         customization for registered users. Next few months will bring 
         reimplementation of the remaining functionalities offered by the legacy
         site and fine-tuning of the caching subsystem which will make the site
         more responsive when dealing with large interaction datasets.
