<p>The <em>core</em> subset of interactions in DIP, a set deemed highly 
reliable by computational evaluation and manual curation, is a great 
resource for examining the properties of real interactions.  These 
properties can be used to judge the quality of high-throughput 
interaction data sets, which generally contain many false-positive and 
false-negative hits.</p>
<p>The tools below will help you evaluate your interaction data based 
on what we've learned from the <em>core</em> DIP data:</p>

    The Expression Profile Reliability Index evaluates the quality of 
    large-scale protein-protein interaction data sets by comparing the 
    expression profiles of the interacting dataset with those of the 
    high-quality (core) subset of yeast interactions in DIP.
