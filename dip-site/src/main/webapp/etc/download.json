These include, both, the records curated by DIP curators as well as these processed by our IMEx Consortium partners. The IMEx datasets are created by concatenating all the IMEx records released by the IMEx Consortium members after importing them into DIP and annotation with cross-references to DIP protein, interaction, evidence and article records.  Therefore, the DIP IMEx datasets constitute the most detailed source of IMEx-compliant experimental records available within DIP. In addition to the <i>incremental</i> datasets created every time a new batch of IMEx records is imported into DIP, the <i>year total</i> and  <i>cumulative</i> sets contain records imported within a given year or, respectively, all the IMEx records imported until the cumulative set's release date.<br/><br/>",
