<p>
  Your protein sequence will be blasted agaist all procaryotic proteins 
  contained in ProLinks. The best matches will be displayed on the 
  screen and you will need to select one or more of them (one at a
  time) to search for functional linkages.

  <br /> <br />
  Once a matched protein is selected, you can submit it directly to 
  ProLinks using default parameters, or you can choose to follow the 
  link to open your protein in a 
  <a class="pl_general" href="page?id=pl_db_id" target="_blank">form</a>
  where you can fine tune the search parameters.


  <br /><br />
  <b>Rationale</b><br />
  If you can find a close homolog to your sequence, assuming that 
  your protein is not directly contained in ProLinks (e.g. because 
  the genome you are working on is not completely sequenced yet), 
  then you can check whether the functional linkages of the homolog 
  give you clues about the posible linkages of your protein.
