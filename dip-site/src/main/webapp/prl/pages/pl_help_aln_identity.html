      The percentage of identities in the alignment relative 
      to the length of the alignment. Given their local nature,
      BLAST alignments tend to be shorter than the length 
      of the query sequence. Therefore, use this value only
      as reference to see how good the alignment was
      (the closer to 100.0, the better), but base your 
      decision on the Global indentity values for the 
      <a class="pl_general" 
	 onclick="YAHOO.mbi.modal.help( 'Global identities in the query sequence', 'pl_help_query_identitities' ); return false" 
	 href="">query</a> and the 
      <a class="pl_general" 
	 onclick="YAHOO.mbi.modal.help( 'Global identities in target protein', 'pl_help_target_identitities' ); return false" 
	 href="">target</a>.
