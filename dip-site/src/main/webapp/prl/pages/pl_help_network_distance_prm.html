<p>
  This refers to how deep in the network of functional 
  linkages ProLinks will search for proteins 
  related to the input query. That is, it indicates how far
  the linked proteins are from the query protein submitted by 
  the user. This is illustrated in the figure below (click on 
  the image to see a larger version). Distance 1 involves 
  Links directly related (one edge away) to the query, and all 
  other distances consist of indirect links (two or more edges 
  away from the query protein).

<p>
  If you are searching for paths of linkages connecting two 
  proteins, the option <b>1+</b> refers to 2-edge paths where 
  all nodes are interconnected forming a triangle motif.
