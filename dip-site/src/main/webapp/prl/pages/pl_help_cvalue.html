<p>
  Given that the individual scores reported by each 
  inference method in ProLinks were calculated under 
  different assumptions and methodologies, these values 
  are not directly comparable. The confidence value is 
  a way to normalize these scores to make them directly 
  comparable and easy to interpret.
</p>

<p>
  Briefly, this value is the global probability that an 
  inferred functional linkage is a true positive given the
  scores reported by each individual inference method. The closer 
  to one, the more likely the inferred linkages will be true
  positives. 
</p>

<p>
  To keep the number of inferences for your query reasonable,
  ProLinks only accepts values <b><i>&ge;0.4</i></b>. Please,
  contact us (e-mail: 
  <a class="pl_general" 
      href="mailto:prolinks@mbi.ucla.edu">prolinks@mbi.ucla.edu</a>)
  if you would like to search inferences at lower levels of confidence.
