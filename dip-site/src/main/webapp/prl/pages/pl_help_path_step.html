   click on the icon 
   <img style="vertical-align:middle;"

	  alt="Submit Protein to ProLinks" />
   located to the right of the number. This
   is a shortcut for copying the ID of 
   the protein and pasting it back on the homepage 
   search box. If, on the other hand, you 
   would like to resubmit an inferred linkage 
   but modify the search parameters, click on the icon 
   <img style="vertical-align:middle;"
          src="images/Adv_submission.png" 
	width="37px"
          alt="Submit Protein to ProLinks" /> to
   open the respective <b>adv</b>anced search form.
