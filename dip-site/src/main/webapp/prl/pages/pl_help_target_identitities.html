      The percentage  of identical residues in the alignment relative
      to the size of the target protein. This number tells you how much 
      of the target protein is identical to the query sequence. The closer 
      this number to 100.0 the better. However, a small number suggests that 
      the query sequence may be part of a bigger or fused protein. 
      So, you can be less stringent with this value (unless you want to 
      force the query sequence and target protein to be about the same size), 
      as compared to the 
      <a class="pl_general" 
	 onclick="YAHOO.mbi.modal.help( 'Global identities in the query sequence', 'pl_help_query_identitities' ); return false" 
	 href="">percentage of identities in the query sequence</a>.
      <br />
      <br />
      If this number is 100.0, it means that your sequence, or part of it, is 
      identical to a complete protein in ProLinks.
