      The ProLinks database is a collection of inferences of functional linkages 
      between proteins using 4 methods. These methods include the Phylogenetic 
      Profile method which uses the presence and absence of proteins across 
      multiple genomes to detect functional linkages; the Gene Cluster method, 
      which uses genome proximity to predict functional linkage; Rosetta Stone, 
      which uses a gene fusion event in a second organism to infer functional 
      relatedness; and the Gene Neighbor method, which uses both gene
      proximity and phylogenetic distribution to infer linkage. Please see
