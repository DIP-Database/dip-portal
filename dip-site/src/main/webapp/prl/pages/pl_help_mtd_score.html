<p>
  The values entered in these fields indicate the
  worst acceptable thresholds for each inference method
  implemented in ProLinks. Since the scores were
  calculated using different methods, they have
  different interpretations (see below). If you want to
  prevent this score from being used, for example, and
  rely only on the
  <a class="pl_general" 
      onclick="YAHOO.mbi.modal.help( 'Confidence value threshold', 'pl_help_cvalue' ); return false" 
      href="">ProLinks score</a>,
  enter any number greater than one to turn it off. 
  For more details on how these scores were calculated, 
  see the following descriptions and our main publication

  <li>
    <b>Phylogenetic Profiles (PP):</b> In short, this score
    is a log ratio between two p-values.  The more
    negative the value the more significant. For
    specific details in the calculation of this score,
    please see the report by Cokus et al

      (Suppl 4):S7</a>). ProLinks accepts values <i>&le;-10</i>.

  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Gene Neighbor (GN):</b> This score is a p-value
    estimated by combining multiple probabilities, which
    results in very small values. ProLinks accepts values
    <i>&le;1e-15</i>. 
    <br /><br />
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Gene Cluster (GC):</b> This score is a p-value. The most
    significant inferences are observed when the p-value is
    <i>&le;0.01</i>. ProLinks accepts values <i>&le;0.02</i>. 
    <br /><br />
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Rosetta Stone (RS):</b> This score is a
    p-value. Similarly to the Gene Cluster method, the
    most significant inferences are observed when the
    p-value is <i>&le;0.01</i>. ProLins accepts any
    value <i>&le;0.1</i>.
    <br /><br />
