The changes will allow us to add, in the nearest future, more user-visible features. However, some changes/addisions are already available. Most prominently, we've incorporated the link validation information to all the tables (<i>eg</i> <A HREF='http://dip.doe-mbi.ucla.edu/dip/Browse.cgi?PK=1143'><i>DIP:1143N</i></A>) and graphs (<i>eg</i> <A HREF='http://dip.doe-mbi.ucla.edu/dip/DIPgraph.cgi?PK=1143'><i>DIP:1143N</i></A>)) listing interactions of <i>S. cerevisiae</i> proteins. Please, note the color coding used to distinguish between the core/non-core links. This information was also used to 'uncrowd' the graph representation of the interaction neighbourhood and make those more usable. We hope the changes will make the database more useful to all of you and, as always, anxiously wait for <A HREF='mailto:dip@mbi.ucla.edu'>comments and suggestions</A>.

Please, see the <A HREF='http://dip.doe-mbi.ucla.edu/dip/Guide.cgi?SM=1'>Search Guide</A> for details. <p>We've also added a large number of cross-references to the <a HREF='http://dip.doe-mbi.ucla.edu/dip/DIPview.cgi?PK=310'> DIP Node</A> pages - just find your preferred protein to check what's present in the  new cross-reference field.

Since this make DIP completely dependent on one database a move towards Swissprot and Genpept accession code has been adopted. Quality of an interaction can be assessed by the number of experimental methods. Since many experiments could describe a protein-protein interaction one could test the validity of an interaction by analyzing the methods involved. Each experiments will be linked to the NCBI Medline Database.UID/PMID code are used as a code to reference each published paper. By linking DIP to the NCBI/NLM Medline Database, scientist can access in a easy way."
