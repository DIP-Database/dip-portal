 - when adding new java files, use etc/template.java to build file headers

 - run:  
     svn propset svn:keywords "Date Author Id Rev HeadURL" file.foo
   on every added file so that the header content is updated during 
   svn check-ins/check-outs

 - do NOT use tab character for formatting 
 - try to keep lines shorter than 80 characters
